# About Nicole

I am an Associate Professor of Mathematics at West Virginia University. For the 2018-2019 academic year, I am a Provost's Academic Leadership Fellow working with Vice Provost John Campbell to improve outcomes in first year math courses.
<p>Mathematics is amazing, and I love to share its mysteries and triumphs with everyone. Watching people struggle to see the awsome power and beauty of Mathematics has lead me to study how students learn, so that I may more effectively share my joy with them. I recognize the importance of the struggle, that understanding requires work and effort. However, I don't want students to be struggling fruitlessly. I study how Mathematics professionals can help students struggle constructively, through more efficient classroom activities, lecture techniques, and even how physical gestures can inform understanding and mastery.
